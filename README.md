# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the role of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It is designed to guide me through the process of documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a booking management system, simulating a real-world development scenario.
By engaging with this project, I will be able to master the principles of requirement gathering, functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, setting for me a strong foundation for successful software delivery.
