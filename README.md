# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the role of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It is designed to guide me through the process of documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a booking management system, simulating a real-world development scenario.
By engaging with this project, I will be able to master the principles of requirement gathering, functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, setting for me a strong foundation for successful software delivery.


# What is Requirement Analysis?
This is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, documented, and validated to serve as a foundation for software development. This process ensures that the final product aligns with business objectives, user needs, and technical feasibility.
The importance of requirement analysis in SDLC includes providing a clear blueprint for developers to ensure team members have a shared understanding of the project goals, minimizing miscommunication by thoroughly documenting the project's requirements, improving the project's planning through a well defined set of requirements,  setting the stage for defining acceptance criteria,which makes it easier to verify that the final product meets expectations, and enhancing stakeholder satisfaction by Involving them early in the project and clearly articulating their needs ensures their satisfaction with the delivered solution.
